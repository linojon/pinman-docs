\[The core PinMan code will be free for non-commercial use. I am considering making it open source also but not until after version 1.0 is developed and released.]

### Premium (Paid) License

\[PinMan will be distributed under dual license. The core of the software will be free for non-commercial use. Individuals and companies may choose to purchase a paid license (one-time or subscription TBD) to help support the project and access advanced features and priority support.
